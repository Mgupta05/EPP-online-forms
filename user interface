                When you present your subject to specialists, you assume them to possess a <input name="q1-0"
                    class="answers" type="text" value=""> background of the ideas and jargon of the field. Not only
                that, you do not
                hesitate to
                <input name="q1-1" class="answers" type="text" value=""> even intricate issues with them. To such an
                audience,
                you
                mainly strive to demonstrate those specific points which are your own <input name="q1-2" class="answers"
                    type="text" value="">, and you try to <input name="q1-3" class="answers" type="text" value=""> these
                points in
                their existing knowledge of the subject.

                The strategy as well as the tone changes when you make an <input name="q1-4" class="answers" type="text"
                    value="">
                of the topic to a general audience. You must then plan your presentation in terms of generally sensible
                ideas
                that can <input name="q1-5" class="answers" type="text" value=""> to educated <input name="q1-6"
                    class="answers" type="text" value="">. First, you concentrate on the broad issues and <input
                    name="q1-7" class="answers" type="text" value=""> from descending into the <input name="q1-8"
                    class="answers" type="text" value="">
                nitty-gritty. Besides, for relatively tricky points, you look for suitable <input name="q1-9"
                    class="answers" type="text" value=""> to drive your point home. While you do all these, your
                treatment of the subject
                must
                still be technically correct.

                "Forgive and forget" is saying used to lightly by people, often when the parties concerned can neither
                forgive or forget. The question of forgiving arise only when one has the authority to punish, not just
                an option to retaliate. A conscious decision to not retaliate against an offence is not forgiving. It can
                be drove by a recognition of the inability to retaliate. In some cases, there may strategic or tactical
                reason, including the quest for common sustained good. Commendable, yes, but it is not same as forgiving. In
                situations when you think of forgiving an offence recognising it as cause by over sight or ignorance,
                you basically do not take offence due that reason, and there is no question of punishing or forgiving. And,
                then is forgetting voluntary. You cannot decide to loose your memory!
